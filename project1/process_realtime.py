Use this code as a template to process images in real time, using the same techniques as the last challenge.
You need to display a (320 x 240) grayscale video feed with a random box in the center of the image. Once
you have presented the first assignment, make a copy of this file and adjust the file to detect faces using
a larger feed resolution (640 x 480).
