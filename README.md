#### Authors: Will Chen, Simon Fong, Brian Henriquez

This is the official code provided for the ECE196 Face Recognition project. All documentation can be found on the [ECE 196 Face Recognition page](https://sites.google.com/view/ece-196/face-recognition).

# Installation
Installation has been covered already in the context of both a local PC and the necessary server/RPi installations. Both can be found in the page above under their appropriate sub-pages. If anything becomes deprecated (or training is too sluggish) due to new package releases on the server, consult the TA as a recompilation of a couple libraries may be necessary.
